bounded_queue
=============

programmer: Dorian Pistilli

Bounded_Queue for integers originally designed for a fellowship application. Built in C++

Built in C++ and designed to follow a spec given in the fellowship app.

Future Updates:
- [ ] create front / enqueue / dequeue interface with only those functions, standardizing its functionality to better fit the C++ stdlib data structures. Also gets rid of that awkward case where the client is popping from an empty list AND expecting to have an int returned... ooh awkward!!!
- [ ] use templates to make the bounded_queue more modular (so that it doesn't only work with ints)
